Project Overview:

The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive Power BI dashboard using the Sakila DVD Rental Store Database, providing valuable insights into the rental store business. The analysis will focus on customer behaviour, film inventory management, staff performance, and store operations. The goal is to enable data-driven decision-making and improve overall business performance. The Power BI dashboard will offer insights into customer segmentation, sales trends, film performance, staff productivity, and store revenue. 

The primary aim is to optimize film inventory, enhance customer satisfaction, improve staff performance, and streamline store operations. The dashboard will provide actionable recommendations for targeted marketing campaigns, film collection enhancements, and staff training initiatives to improve business performance. The final deliverables will include a report and presentation showcasing the dashboard's findings and recommendations. The Power BI dashboard will serve as a valuable tool for rental store owners to make informed decisions and achieve success in the competitive DVD rental market.

In addition to creating a Power BI dashboard, this project also includes a vital phase of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA involves the use of SQL queries to extract and examine the dataset for critical insights. SQL queries were employed to address specific problem statements related to customer behaviour, film inventory, staff performance, and store operations. These queries helped uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data.

To Present the results of the EDA effectively, visualizations were prepared and organized in an Excel file. These visualizations include charts, graphs, and tables that highlight key findings and patterns. The Excel file serves as a complementary resource to the Power BI dashboard, providing stakeholders with a comprehensive view of the project's insights.
